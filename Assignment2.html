<header><h2>Problem:</h2>

    You have a Python script that sorts a list of strings alphabetically. However, when you run the script, it doesn't sort the strings correctly and returns the list unchanged.
    <h2>Procedure:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Check the script for any syntax errors or typos.</li>
        <li>Verify that the input list is being passed correctly to the sorting function.</li>
        <li>Check the sorting function to ensure it is correctly sorting the list of strings.</li>
        <li>Test the script with a different input list to see if the issue persists.</li>
        <li>Consider using a different sorting algorithm or method to see if it resolves the issue.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Result:</h2>
    After following the above steps, the issue was identified as a typo in the sorting function that was causing it to return the list unchanged. Once the typo was corrected, the script successfully sorted the list of strings alphabetically.
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    It is important to carefully review and test your code to identify and fix any issues that may be causing unexpected behavior. By following a systematic approach to troubleshooting, you can quickly identify and resolve problems in your code.
    <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
    When troubleshooting code, start by checking for syntax errors, typos, and other common mistakes. Then, verify that the input data is being processed correctly and that the expected output is being generated. If the issue persists, consider testing different scenarios and approaches to identify the root cause of the problem.
    <h2>Feedback:</h2>
    The feedback from the user was positive, as they were able to quickly identify and fix the issue with the script. They appreciated the systematic approach to troubleshooting and found the recommendations helpful for future debugging tasks.
    <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
    To further improve the script, consider adding error handling and input validation to handle unexpected data or edge cases. Additionally, you could optimize the sorting algorithm for better performance with large datasets.
    <h2>Follow-up:</h2>
    Follow up with the user to ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and that they are satisfied with the script's performance. Offer additional assistance or resources if needed to support their ongoing development efforts.
